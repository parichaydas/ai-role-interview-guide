# ML Systems Design

## Overview

Designing ML systems for production requires careful consideration of multiple components and trade-offs.

## Key Components

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and storage
- Model training and evaluation
- Model serving and inference
- Monitoring and retraining

## Scalability Considerations

- Data volume and velocity
- Model complexity
- Inference latency requirements
- Cost optimization

## System Patterns

- Batch processing pipelines
- Real-time inference services
- Online learning systems
