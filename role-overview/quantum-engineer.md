# Quantum Engineer Role Overview

## Role Description

A Quantum Engineer designs, develops, and deploys quantum computing solutions and hybrid quantum-classical systems. They apply quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning (QML), and hardware-aware optimizations to solve domain problems and evaluate quantum advantage opportunities.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design and implement quantum algorithms (e.g., QFT, VQE, QAOA) and QML models
- Develop hybrid quantum-classical workflows and integrations with classical ML systems
- Prototype and benchmark algorithms on simulators and real quantum hardware
- Optimize quantum circuits for noise, depth, and qubit resource constraints
- Use quantum SDKs and cloud platforms (Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, Amazon Braket, Azure Quantum)
- Apply error mitigation, noise modeling, and validation strategies
- Collaborate with researchers and engineers to identify practical use cases and production-readiness criteria

## Key Skills

- Strong foundation in quantum computing fundamentals (qubits, gates, entanglement, decoherence)
- Knowledge of quantum algorithms and complexity theory
- Experience with quantum SDKs, simulators, and cloud backends
- Proficiency in Python, numerical linear algebra, and scientific computing
- Familiarity with error mitigation, benchmarking, and hardware constraints
- Ability to translate classical problems into quantum or hybrid formulations

## Interview Focus Areas

- Quantum computing basics and algorithm intuition
- Circuit design, optimization, and resource trade-offs
- Hybrid quantum-classical system design and integration
- Error mitigation, noise characterization, and benchmarking
- Hands-on experience with Qiskit/Cirq/PennyLane or equivalent
- Evaluating when quantum approaches provide practical advantage
