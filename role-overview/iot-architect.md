# IoT Architect Role Overview

## Role Description

An IoT Architect designs and leads the architecture of Internet of Things systems, integrating devices, edge computing, connectivity, cloud services, and data pipelines to deliver secure, scalable, and maintainable IoT solutions.

## Key Responsibilities

- Define IoT system architecture and standards
- Select device platforms, connectivity protocols, and edge compute strategies
- Design secure device provisioning, authentication, and firmware update mechanisms
- Architect data ingestion, processing, and storage pipelines for IoT telemetry
- Ensure scalability, reliability, and real-time processing requirements
- Collaborate with hardware, software, security, and cloud teams
- Mentor engineering teams and guide operationalization (monitoring, OTA, lifecycle management)

## Key Skills

- Embedded systems and firmware fundamentals
- Networking and connectivity protocols (MQTT, CoAP, LwM2M, BLE, LoRaWAN)
- Edge computing and real-time data processing
- Cloud IoT platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google Cloud IoT)
- Security for constrained devices, PKI, secure boot, and secure OTA
- Data engineering and streaming (MQTT brokers, Kafka, stream processing)
- System design, scalability, and observability
- DevOps, CI/CD, and OTA update workflows

## Interview Focus Areas

- Designing scalable and resilient IoT architectures
- Edge vs cloud processing trade-offs and partitioning
- Device security, provisioning, and lifecycle management
- Dealing with intermittent connectivity and low-power devices
- Protocol selection and justification (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LoRaWAN)
- Telemetry data modeling, ingestion pipelines, and storage strategies
- Firmware update approaches and rollbacks
- Operational concerns: monitoring, cost, and device fleet management

## Domains & Use Cases

- Industrial IoT (IIoT) and manufacturing automation
- Smart cities and infrastructure
- Connected vehicles and telematics
- Consumer IoT and smart home device
- Healthcare and wearables
- Energy management and smart grids
